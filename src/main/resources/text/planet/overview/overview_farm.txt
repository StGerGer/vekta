Sprawling fields of exotic creatures surround you in every direction.
You land among fields of alien crops.
You land just in time to see the crops harvesting themselves.
The inhabitants seem happy about your arrival.
The entire planet echoes with the screams of alien livestock.
You park your ship in a nearby crop circle.
Creatures scuttle away from your ship as you land.
