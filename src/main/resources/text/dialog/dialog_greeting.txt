Good day, traveler! It's been a while since last time I've seen you. *Likewise. *Who are you?
What's up, my dude? I'd heard that you might be passing by. 
Hello there! *Hi. *You are a bold one. 
Howdy!
How are you today? *I'm fine, thanks. *Good. *Yes.
Hey! What are you doing flying out here? *Just snooping around. *Nice to see you again, old friend.
It seems the stories are true...
You... *Yes? *Me.
