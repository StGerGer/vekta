{description_item_rare}
We got this * for free at an auction because literally nobody else wanted it. 
It ain't the {item}, but it'll do.
{item_adj_common}, {item_adj_common}, and most importantly, {item_adj_common}. 
We have absolutely no idea where this came from. It just appeared in our shop one day. 
It's similar to that {item_common} that {action_past_bad}. 
Only the bravest among us can get more than one use out of this. 
You don't want to know where this * has been...
We're selling this at a discount for many, many reasons. 
This is most likely the worst * in existence. 
Sometimes, if you listen closely, you can hear it shouting insults at you. 
Be careful with this one. 
(It's very obviously broken)
{boss_modifier} sold separately. 
Probably your only chance to own a *.
It's actually a repurposed {item_noun} {item_modifier}. 
We can't seem to get rid of this thing.
