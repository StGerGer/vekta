## What is this?

- Procedural missions, lore, and dialog.
- Modular ship customization and item crafting. 
- Visitable locations such as cities, shipyards, outposts, and hideouts.
- Colonization and city management.
- Mysterious dungeons, temples, and shipwrecks.
- Player-affected economies, real estate, and bond markets.
- Mining, data scanning, and ecological research.

## Code Styling

If you're using an IDE, there is an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file provided in the root directory that will allow you automatically format your code as expected.
See [IntelliJ's documentation on EditorConfig files](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-code-style.html#editorconfig) to see how it's used, or [install this addon for Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/editorconfig-eclipse).

If you're not able to use the EditorConfig file, here are some of the more important points:

- Indents should be four spaces.
- Brackets should be placed on the lines with keywords: `for (...) { ...`, `while (...) {...`
