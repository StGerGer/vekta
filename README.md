## Code Styling

There is an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file provided in the root directory that will allow you automatically format your code as expected.
See [IntelliJ's documentation on EditorConfig files](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-code-style.html#editorconfig) to see how it's used, or [install this addon for Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/editorconfig-eclipse).
