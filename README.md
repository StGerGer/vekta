## :capital_abcd: :mega: Grade Feedback:
See the [grading rubric, team project grade and instructor feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIPCubrIOaV_vDfekUT-mahBOSUPFhTn5mocP2YGAUM/edit?usp=sharing). This Google spreadsheet:
- is shared **only** with the team members
- will be updated after each major project milestone (e.g., initial planning, sprint)

## Code Styling

If you're using an IDE, there is an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file provided in the root directory that will allow you to automatically format your code as expected.
See [IntelliJ's documentation on EditorConfig files](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-code-style.html#editorconfig) to see how it's used, or [install this addon for Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/editorconfig-eclipse).

If you're not able to use the EditorConfig file, here are some of the more important points:

- Indents should be four spaces.
- Open brackets should be placed on the lines with keywords: `for (...) { ...`, `while (...) {...`
- Close brackets get their own line.
- All variables, methods, and classes should be camelCase (First word capitalized for classes) except for constants, which should be all caps with underscores between words (for example, `EARTH_MASS`).
- Getters and setters should be prefixed with `get` and `set` respectively, like `getVelocity()` or `setMass()`.
- Methods should generally be under 50 lines.

## Contribution Guidelines

All contributions should follow good software engineering practices. Epics, stories, and tasks should be created in Github's Issues feature, and moved accordingly within the scrum board project.
Commits should reference which task they are implementing, e.g. "Implements #7".
